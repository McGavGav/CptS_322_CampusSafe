# Sprint 1 Report 
Video Link: https://youtu.be/Z5MYjvhR47M
## What's New (User Facing)
 * Creating kanban board adding different features 
   Features working on: Register, Access Safety Resources, view report history, Emergency Button, and report incident 
   Having code and graphics 


## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
We learned a lot more about coding these features in python and django and how this will help our team with 
implementing all of these safety features into one app. We did have to communicate a lot through text as this 
was assigned with a break so it was hard as some of us were out of town; however we just all took an issue and worked independently. 
In the future we hope to work more as a team and meet up to implement and put everything together.

## Unfinished Work
We still have to work on the incident maps, severe weather alert, and incident notification features that we 
plan to accomplish within our next sprint. We also are all still in the progress of working on the different features of 
register, access safety resources, emergency button, report incident, and view report history.

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
  * Each team member completed a feature
  * Was able to understand and grasp a basic foundation of what our app will look like
  * Have all of the features that were worked on in working condition
 
Here's what we'd like to improve:
   * Django implementation
   * Communication
   * Overall planning

Here's what did not go well
  * We were not able to put together all of our features 
  * Meeting up and working on the project as a whole team was difficult 
  * Did not get far along as we hoped

  
Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
   * Work on the remaining features
   * Put together the features in one app
   * Meet up and talk about what remaining qualities and features we want to implement in our app
